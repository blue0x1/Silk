Silk Shoutbox is a lightweight, single-file PHP shoutbox focused on security and simplicity. It requires no setup, stores all data using AES-256 encryption, and operates without logs. Admins can control access with generated keys, manage user profiles, and purge data as needed. Ideal for private, encrypted communications.
